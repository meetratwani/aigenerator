# 🎨 Drawing Studio - SIMPLE STARTUP GUIDE

## The Problem: "Unable to POST"

When you try to submit a drawing, it doesn't work.

## The Solution: 3 Simple Steps

### Step 1: Open PowerShell
```
Location: C:\Users\Meet\OneDrive\Desktop\ArpitSir
```

### Step 2: Start the Server
```powershell
python server.py
```

### Step 3: Wait for This Message
```
🚀 Starting Flask API Server on http://localhost:5000
```

**⏳ IMPORTANT:** This may take 10-15 minutes on first run!

---

## After Server Starts

1. **DO NOT CLOSE** the PowerShell window
2. Open **drawing_app.html** in your browser
3. Draw something
4. Click **"Submit Drawing"**
5. Get your prediction! ✨

## Common Issues

### "I don't see the startup message"
- The server is still training (first run = 10-15 minutes)
- Keep waiting and watch the terminal

### "Error or connection refused"
- Make sure you're in the right folder
- Try: `cd C:\Users\Meet\OneDrive\Desktop\ArpitSir`
- Then: `python server.py`

### "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'"
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Then try again: `python server.py`

### "Port already in use"
- Another app is using port 5000
- Close other Python windows or change port
- Try: `python server.py` again

## The Key: Keep Server Running! 🔑

```
Terminal 1 (Keep Open)          Terminal 2 / Browser
┌─────────────────────┐        ┌──────────────────┐
│ python server.py    │        │ Open              │
│ (Running...)        │        │ drawing_app.html  │
│                     │        │                  │
│ DO NOT CLOSE!       │   -->  │ Draw & Submit    │
└─────────────────────┘        └──────────────────┘
```

## Quick Test

Check if server is working:
```
Open browser: http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

Should show: `{"status":"Server is running", ...}`

If yes ✅ → Server is working, open drawing_app.html
If no ❌ → Server is not running, check PowerShell window

---

## Still Not Working?

1. Read: **TROUBLESHOOTING.html** (open in browser)
2. Read: **FETCH_TROUBLESHOOTING.md**
3. Run: `python test_connection.ps1`

---

**That's it! The server must be running to use the drawing app.** 🚀
